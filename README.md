🚨 Disaster Response & Management System (DRMS)
A centralized platform to bridge the gap between victims, rescue agencies, and volunteers during critical emergencies.

📖 Overview
In the wake of natural or man-made disasters, communication often breaks down, leading to delayed rescue operations and misallocation of resources. The Disaster Response & Management System (DRMS) is a full-stack web/mobile solution designed to streamline coordination.

It allows victims to broadcast SOS signals with geolocation, enables volunteers to register and find tasks, and provides authorities with a real-time dashboard to manage resources and deployment.
